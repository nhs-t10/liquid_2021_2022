## A Word to the Wise

Constants aren't really constant. It's closer to a final *method*, since they're just resistant to being *overridden*. If they choose to change, they definitely can.

e.g. `I promise that the drumSpeed is the drumMotor with a scale of 1`. `drumSpeed` may still change. It's just safe from being overridden.

## Built-Ins 

nothing; dead; zilch = 0
time = {ms since start}
hundred = 100
god; real = 1
